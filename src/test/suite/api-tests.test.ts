/**
 * This file serves as a bridge for including API tests in the main test suite.
 * It contains simplified versions of the Gemini API tests to ensure they run
 * with the main test suite.
 *
 * NOTE: We're using CommonJS-style imports for Mocha (require) due to VS Code's test runner
 * compatibility requirements. This is necessary because VS Code's test infrastructure
 * requires CommonJS modules even when using nodenext module resolution. The rest of the
 * codebase uses ESM imports, but tests need CommonJS for compatibility with VS Code testing.
